Structure

The Central Council members comprise:

  * Representative Members elected by the affiliated Societies for a three year period;
  * Individual Members enrolled or appointed as may be determined by the Standing Orders; and
  * the Council’s Trustees, Stewards and Workgroup Leaders, who shall be ex-officio members.

The Central Council has maintained Rules and Decisions for over 120 years.   Its Rules deal with the fundamentals of its governance, entry criteria, subscriptions etc. whilst its Decisions relate to arrangements for ringing or ringing societies.   Under the Council’s current constitution, the more modern words “Policy” and “Standard” can alternate with Decision, but the meaning is the same.

More recently, in common with other organisations, the Council has developed a separate suite of internal Policies and Standards governing its own charitable work.

The [Executive Officers](../about/executive/) are elected by the Council at the annual meeting.

The Rules and Standing Orders were adopted by the <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Transition-Motionv1-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transition Motion</a> which contains certain provisions relating to the previous rules and policies of the Central Council.

    Framework for Method Ringing
    
    **Framework for Method Ringing**
    
    The Framework for Method Ringing is a Standard that provides common language and terminology for describing many aspects of method ringing, including performance reporting. It also contains the Central Council’s requirements for adding new methods to the Central Council’s methods library, for classifying and extending methods, and for record length performances. It is provided to support effective communication within the ringing community and is currently the Council’s only “Decision” (a Policy or Standard dealing with arrangements for ringing or ringing societies).  The Council’s earlier <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CC-Decisions-as-at-29-May-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decisions</a>. were retired in 2019.
    
    The first version of the framework was approved by the Executive on 24 February 2019 and became effective on 1 June 2019.

    Budget
    
    The CCCBR Executive agreed to the following General Fund budget for 2019 at their meeting of 28 November 2018. The figures are influenced by the carry over of a proportion of the Ringing Remembers Grant and the agreement to a number of one off Workgroup project expenses for 2019.
    
    The Treasurer is always happy to answer any questions on the agreed budget.
