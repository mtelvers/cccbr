            Successful recruitment and retention of new ringers is essential. In order to achieve success, we need to plan for both recruitment and retention <em>simultaneously</em>. Will you retain the new ringer(s) you have just recruited? How will you integrate them into your existing band?<br />The resources available here have been designed to help you achieve this.
