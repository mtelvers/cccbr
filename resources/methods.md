The Central Council maintains and publishes records of methods which have been rung in peals and quarters, and provides advice to ringers about methods, method extension and other technical matters. The online CCCBR Methods Library contains over 20,000 methods, and is maintained by the [Technical and Taxonomy Workgroup](/about/workgroups/technical-and-taxonomy).&nbsp;

**Methods Library**

The <a href="https://methods.cccbr.tunbury.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Council Methods Library</a> contains lists of methods by place notation in various formats. A searchable database of methods which displays blue lines and useful information such as method properties, first performances and suitable compositions can be found in <a href="https://complib.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composition Library</a>.

**Framework for Method Ringing**

The <a href="https://framework.cccbr.tunbury.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framework for Method Ringing</a> is a Standard that provides common language and terminology for describing many aspects of method ringing, and it also contains the Central Council&apos;s requirements for adding new methods to the Central Council&apos;s methods library, for classifying and extending methods, and for record length performances. It is provided to support effective communication within the ringing community, and is an important reference if you wish to name a new method, extend a method, or are unsure how to record a performance.

The first version of the framework was approved by the Executive on 24&nbsp;February 2019 and became effective on 1&nbsp;June 2019.

**Decisions**

The Councilâ€™s earlier&nbsp;<a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CC-Decisions-as-at-29-May-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decisions</a> governing, among other things, Peal Ringing and Methods were withdrawn on 1&nbsp;June 2019 and have been superseded by the Framework for Method Ringing.

**Questions and advice**

The Methods team of the Technical and Taxonomy Workgroup has an expert panel which can answer questions about methods including those on the Framework for Method Ringing, method classification, method extension and method naming.

Questions can be sent by email to [cccbr\_sc\_email address=&#8221;methods@cccbr.tunbury.org&#8221; text=&#8221;methods@cccbr.tunbury.org&#8221;].
