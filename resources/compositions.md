The Central Council maintains and publishes collections of compositions, encourages an interest in ringing theory and composition through articles and seminars, and provides advice to ringers about compositions.

**Online Composition Collections  
** 

There are many online composition collections now available, either containing compositions for an individual composer, those rung for a society, or broader collections. The <a href="http://ringing.info#compositions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wplink-url-error="true">Change Ringing Resources</a> website provides a useful index of these together with other resources related to composition.

**Composition Library**

<a href="https://complib.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composition Library</a> is a website that allows composers and others to self-publish compositions and conductors to search for compositions suitable for a particular method or methods, even if not originally composed for them. The Compositions team of the [Technical & Taxonomy Workgroup](/about/workgroups/technical-and-taxonomy) is now using this resource to record the compositions used when methods are first rung, to capture innovative and noteworthy compositions that have been rung recently, and ultimately to capture compositions from all printed and online collections to provide a single comprehensive reference resource for compositions.

**Publications**

Historically an important part of the Council’s work has been overseeing the creation and publication of collections of compositions. With the advent of searchable online collections, the need and demand for printed publications is declining. However the Workgroup will consider producing further publications if a case can be made. Many of the printed collections can still be obtained from the <a href="/shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Council Shop</a> and where they are out of print, they can be downloaded for free.
