The following documents provide some idea on what the purpose of the Central Council is and what it can offer to Associations and ringers.&nbsp; However it does rely on the involvement of a group of volunteers who are either Council Representative for their Association or willing participants in the activities of the Council.&nbsp; This suite of documents provides some insight into the support that the Central Council can offer, but the need for the support of volunteers and why we ask people to become involved.
