                This guidance is intended to enable school-age ringers (18 and under) to resume bellringing in a Church tower or private ring and has been developed with the House of Bishops’ Covid Recovery Team, comparing ringers with singers and organists in church settings.&nbsp;
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The UK government has published specific government guidance for running supervised children’s activities in out-of-school settings which comes into effect from 12<sup>th</sup> April at the earliest:
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" target="_blank">Protective measures for holiday and after-school clubs, and other out-of-school settings during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            The government guidance above, which we recommend you read in full, is relatively permissive, giving organisers of groups plenty of things to consider about a particular activity and setting, putting the onus on you and the ‘venue owner’ (incumbent, Churchwardens, PCC) to decide what is right for your tower.&nbsp;
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Points to note particularly are the references to maintaining face coverings especially if social distancing cannot be maintained, the&nbsp;importance of ventilation&nbsp;of the space, and hand hygiene.&nbsp;
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A reasonable young ringers’ session, based on that guidance and the Places of Worship guidance, would be as follows:&nbsp;
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose a tower that is either ground floor with through draught, or a tower with good ventilation (it should feel breezy)&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              A lighter ring of bells is preferable. Exertion ringing heavier bells may result in an increase in aerosol droplets in the ringing room.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep the total session to an hour, or an hour’s ringing with breaks in between where you leave the finding chamber (play outside, ringing handbells in a different space, etc.)&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit the group to 10 children, but don’t have them all in the tower at the same time
            </li>
            <li>
              When considering the size of the group, consider their age and ability to keep distanced, the size of the space, breakout areas, the degree of ventilation
            </li>
            <li>
              Ideally have smaller groups and keep those groups consistent from week to week
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintain distancing when not ringing, and keep the ringing of adjacent bells to short touches
            </li>
            <li>
              Ropes can be shared, but it is important therefore to sanitise hands between ringing
            </li>
            <li>
              Facemasks in ringing chamber at all times
            </li>
            <li>
              One DBS checked adult in the ringing chamber, one other nearby, and parents nearby
            </li>
            <li>
              If the adult needs to ring in order to make ringing viable they can do
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage parents not to hang around together at the tower door
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            As always with young ringers’ practices it is important to have parental consent who should be made aware of this guidance. Some churches will have&nbsp;a track and trace QR code or NHS QR code. Ringers should check in.&nbsp;
          </p>
          
          <p>
            All this is a balance. If one aspect of guidance is difficult in your tower, compensate with something else. The guidance clearly allows reasonable compromises; however it does have a specific list of items with MUST attached to them as follows:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <em>Providers (including their staff where applicable) must always:</em>
          </p>
          
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <em>Minimise contact with individuals who are required to self-isolate by ensuring they do not attend your setting.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Ensure face coverings are used in recommended circumstances.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Ensure everyone is advised to clean their hands thoroughly and more often than usual.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Ensure good respiratory hygiene for everyone by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Maintain enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Consider how to minimise contact across the site and maintain social distancing wherever possible.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Keep occupied spaces well ventilated.</em>
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>
            So those items are law, whereas the rest is guidance.&nbsp;
