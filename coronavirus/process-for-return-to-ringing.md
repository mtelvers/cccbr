                A <em>typical</em> process would be:
              </p>
              
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  Informal discussion between tower captain, ringers, Churchwardens, PCC and incumbent (or Chapter and Dean), whether to consider a restart of ringing, a continuation of the current level of ringing, or a change in the policy for ringing in your tower.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  A review takes place (using advice published by the CCCBR, and if appropriate informal support from an Association / Guild advisor), concerning the characteristics of <ul>
                    <li>
                      the tower
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      the ringers (all are given a copy of “Individual Risks” document to help them to decide for themselves)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      the community (in particular what Tier it is in).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  A Risk Assessment for the resumption of ringing is undertaken by the Health and Safety Officer of the PCC (assisted by the Tower Captain).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A physical check of the bells takes place and any necessary repairs made.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sign off with Incumbent, Churchwardens and PCC.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Resumption of ringing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regular review – dependent on the health / risk exposure of the ringers, local community Tier status and amendments in CCCBR guidance.
                </li>
              </ol>
